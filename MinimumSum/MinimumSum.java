The code works by first finding the smallest value among the elements from the start of the array up to each position and storing these values. It also stores the running total of these smallest values for quick access. It begins by calculating the total of these minimum values without making any changes to the array. Then it considers the effect of performing the allowed operation at each possible position. The operation sets one element to the sum of itself and a later element while making that later element zero, which reduces all subsequent prefix minimums to zero. For each possible position of the operation, the code calculates the new total and keeps track of the smallest total found. The answer is the smallest total value obtained from either not performing the operation at all or performing it at the best position.
